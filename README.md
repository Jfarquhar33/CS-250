### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
```
You really have to use active listening skills to interpret what users would be conveying to you if going through an interview or other vocal source. Otherwise, if you are mostly starting blind, putting yourself in place of the user and determining what features you would find beneficial or a necessity. User stories allow to make each feature into an action item which can then be organized by order of importance. After you get the base program running, the user stories are all additional features that either should or could be additional improvements upon the final project.

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
```
It is best to get a rough outline of what you want to accomplish with the program, more or less a bare bones functioning version. After that you can try and figure out other branches for other features you would want to include. Then finally begin with coding. For agile, getting the initial bare bones version working is extremely beneficial, because then you have something actually working and you are then able to work off of that. This concept is absolutely something I will be bringing forward with me in the future.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
```
So much goes into being a good team member that it is extremely hard to put it fully into words. So much of it is being personable and approachable. If you are easy to talk to, it is significantly easier for a fellow teammember to approach you asking for help or assistance, it also gives you that same freedom to ask others. Being reliable is also very important. If you cannot be expected to complete your work, then how much are you actually contributing to the team?
